  <h1>Azure Static Website Template</h1>
  <p>
    This page is a sample page for a "Hello World" Azure Static Website Template.
    The page contained an HTML validation warning. Can you find and fix that warning?
    What about the curly quotes? Do they currently work in all browsers? The curly
    quotes have been replaced, and the document is properly indented.
